        <p>
            The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyla Anchor nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the product of a flawed
            Soviet reactor design coupled with serious mistakes made by the plant operatorsb. It was a direct
            consequence of
            Cold War isolation and the resulting lack of any safety culture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The accident destroyed the Chernobyl 4 reactor, killing 30 operators and firemen within three months and
            several
            further deaths later. One person was killed immediately and a second died in hospital soon after as a result
            of
            injuries received. Another person is reported to have died at the time from a coronary thrombosisc. Acute
            radiation syndrome (ARS) was originally diagnosed in 237 people onsite and involved with the clean-up and it
            was
            later confirmed in 134 cases. Of these, 28 people died as a result of ARS within a few weeks of the
            accident.</p>
        <p>
            Nineteen more workers subsequently died between 1987 and 2004, but their deaths cannot necessarily be
            attributed
            to radiation exposured. Nobody offsite suffered from acute radiation effects although a significant, but
            uncertain, fraction of the thyroid cancers diagnosed since the accident in patients who were children at the
            time are likely to be due to intake of radioactive iodine falloutm,9. Furthermore, large areas of Belarus,
            Ukraine, Russia, and beyond were contaminated in varying degrees. See also sections below and Chernobyl
            Accident
            Appendix 2: Health Impacts. The Chernobyl disaster was a unique event and the only accident in the history
            of
            commercial nuclear power where radiation-related fatalities occurrede.</p>
        <p class="one">design of the reactor is unique and
            in that respect the accident is thus of little relevance to the rest of the nuclear industry outside the
            then
            Eastern Bloc. However, it led to major changes in safety culture and in industry cooperation, particularly
            between East and West before the end of the Soviet Union. Former President Gorbachev said that the Chernobyl
            accident was a more important factor in the fall of the Soviet Union than Perestroika – his program of
            liberal
            reform.

        <h1 id="">The Chernobyl site and plant</h1>
        <p>The Chernobyl Power Complex, lying about 130 km north of Kiev, Ukraine, and about 20 km south of the border
            with
            Belarus, consisted of four nuclear reactors of the RBMK-1000 design (see information page on RBMK Reactors).
            Units 1 and 2 were constructed between 1970 and 1977, while units 3 and 4 of the same design were completed
            in
            1983. Two more RBMK reactors were under construction at the site at the time of the accident. To the
            southeast
            of the plant, an artificial lake of some 22 square kilometres, situated beside the river Pripyat, a
            tributary of
            the Dniepr, was constructed to provide cooling water for the reactors.</p>
        <p>This area of Ukraine is described as Belarussian-type woodland with a low population density. About 3 km away
            from the reactor, in the new city, Pripyat, there were 49,000 inhabitants. The old town of Chornobyl, which
            had
            a population of 12,500, is about 15 km to the southeast of the complex. Within a 30 km radius of the power
            plant, the total population was between 115,000 and 135,000 at the time of the accident.</p>
        <div class="chernobyl2">
            <img src="img/chernobyl2.gif">
        </div>
        <p>The RBMK-1000 is a Soviet-designed and built graphite moderated pressure tube type reactor, using slightly
            enriched (2% U-235) uranium dioxide fuel. It is a boiling light water reactor, with two loops feeding steam
            directly to the turbines, without an intervening heat exchanger. Water pumped to the bottom of the fuel
            channels
            boils as it progresses up the pressure tubes, producing steam which feeds two 500 MWe turbines. The water
            acts
            as a coolant and also provides the steam used to drive the turbines. The vertical pressure tubes contain the
            zirconium alloy clad uranium dioxide fuel around which the cooling water flows. The extensions of the fuel
            channels penetrate the lower plate and the cover plate of the core and are welded to each. A specially
            designed
            refuelling machine allows fuel bundles to be changed without shutting down the reactor.</p>
        <p>The moderator, the function of which is to slow down neutrons to make them more efficient in producing
            fission in
            the fuel, is graphite, surrounding the pressure tubes. A mixture of nitrogen and helium is circulated
            between
            the graphite blocks to prevent oxidation of the graphite and to improve the transmission of the heat
            produced by
            neutron interactions in the graphite to the fuel channel. The core itself is about 7 m high and about 12 m
            in
            diameter. In each of the two loops, there are four main coolant circulating pumps, one of which is always on
            standby. The reactivity or power of the reactor is controlled by raising or lowering 211 control rods,
            which,
            when lowered into the moderator, absorb neutrons and reduce the fission rate. The power output of this
            reactor
            is 3200 MW thermal, or 1000 MWe. Various safety systems, such as an emergency core cooling system, were
            incorporated into the reactor design.</p>
        <p class="two">One of the most important characteristics of the RBMK reactor is that it can possess a 'positive
            void
            coefficient', where an increase in steam bubbles ('voids') is accompanied by an increase in core reactivity
            (see
            information page on RBMK Reactors). As steam production in the fuel channels increases, the neutrons that
            would
            have been absorbed by the denser water now produce increased fission in the fuel. There are other components
            that contribute to the overall power coefficient of reactivity, but the void coefficient is the dominant one
            in
            RBMK reactors. The void coefficient depends on the composition of the core – a new RBMK core will have a
            negative void coefficient. However, at the time of the accident at Chernobyl 4, the reactor's fuel burn-up,
            control rod configuration, and power level led to a positive void coefficient large enough to overwhelm all
            other influences on the power coefficient.</p>

        <div id="cap3"></div>
        <h1>The 1986 Chernobyl accident</h1>
        <p>On 25 April, prior to a routine shutdown, the reactor crew at Chernobyl 4 began preparing for a test to
            determine
            how long turbines would spin and supply power to the main circulating pumps following a loss of main
            electrical
            power supply. This test had been carried out at Chernobyl the previous year, but the power from the turbine
            ran
            down too rapidly, so new voltage regulator designs were to be tested.</p>
        <p>A series of operator actions, including the disabling of automatic shutdown mechanisms, preceded the
            attempted
            test early on 26 April. By the time that the operator moved to shut down the reactor, the reactor was in an
            extremely unstable condition. A peculiarity of the design of the control rods caused a dramatic power surge
            as
            they were inserted into the reactor (see Chernobyl Accident Appendix 1: Sequence of Events).</p>
        <p>The interaction of very hot fuel with the cooling water led to fuel fragmentation along with rapid steam
            production and an increase in pressure. The design characteristics of the reactor were such that substantial
            damage to even three or four fuel assemblies would – and did – result in the destruction of the reactor. The
            overpressure caused the 1000 t cover plate of the reactor to become partially detached, rupturing the fuel
            channels and jamming all the control rods, which by that time were only halfway down. Intense steam
            generation
            then spread throughout the whole core (fed by water dumped into the core due to the rupture of the emergency
            cooling circuit) causing a steam explosion and releasing fission products to the atmosphere. About two to
            three
            seconds later, a second explosion threw out fragments from the fuel channels and hot graphite. There is some
            dispute among experts about the character of this second explosion, but it is likely to have been caused by
            the
            production of hydrogen from zirconium-steam reactions.</p>
        <p>Two workers died as a result of these explosions. The graphite (about a quarter of the 1200 tonnes of it was
            estimated to have been ejected) and fuel became incandescent and started a number of firesf, causing the
            main
            release of radioactivity into the environment. A total of about 14 EBq (14 x 1018 Bq) of radioactivity was
            released, over half of it being from biologically-inert noble gases.*</p>
        <p class="three">* The figure of 5.2 EBq is also quoted, this being "iodine-131 equivalent" - 1.8 EBq iodine and
            85
            PBq Cs-137 multiplied by 40 due its longevity, and ignoring the 6.5 EBq xenon-33 and some minor or
            short-lived
            nuclides.</p>
        <p class="four">About 200-300 tonnes of water per hour was injected into the intact half of the reactor using
            the
            auxiliary feedwater pumps but this was stopped after half a day owing to the danger of it flowing into and
            flooding units 1 and 2. From the second to tenth day after the accident, some 5000 tonnes of boron,
            dolomite,
            sand, clay, and lead were dropped on to the burning core by helicopter in an effort to extinguish the blaze
            and
            limit the release of radioactive particles.</p>

        <p class="five">The damaged Chernobyl unit 4 reactor building</p>
        <p class="six">The 1991 report by the State Committee on the Supervision of Safety in Industry and Nuclear Power
            on
            the root cause of the accident looked past the operator actions. It said that while it was certainly true
            the
            operators placed their reactor in a dangerously unstable condition (in fact in a condition which virtually
            guaranteed an accident) it was also true that in doing so they had not in fact violated a number of vital
            operating policies and principles, since no such policies and principles had been articulated. Additionally,
            the
            operating organisation had not been made aware either of the specific vital safety significance of
            maintaining a
            minimum operating reactivity margin, or the general reactivity characteristics of the RBMK which made low
            power
            operation extremely hazardous.</p>
        <div id="cap4"></div>
        <h1>Immediate impact of the Chernobyl accident</h1>
        <p>The accident caused the largest uncontrolled radioactive release into the environment ever recorded for any
            civilian operation, and large quantities of radioactive substances were released into the air for about 10
            days.
            This caused serious social and economic disruption for large populations in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine.
            Two
            radionuclides, the short-lived iodine-131 and the long-lived caesium-137, were particularly significant for
            the
            radiation dose they delivered to members of the public.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that all of the xenon gas, about half of the iodine and caesium, and at least 5% of the
            remaining
            radioactive material in the Chernobyl 4 reactor core (which had 192 tonnes of fuel) was released in the
            accident. Most of the released material was deposited close by as dust and debris, but the lighter material
            was
            carried by wind over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and to some extent over Scandinavia and Europe.</p>
        <p>The casualties included firefighters who attended the initial fires on the roof of the turbine building. All
            these were put out in a few hours, but radiation doses on the first day were estimated to range up to 20,000
            millisieverts (mSv), causing 28 deaths – six of which were firemen – by the end of July 1986.</p>
        <p>The next task was cleaning up the radioactivity at the site so that the remaining three reactors could be
            restarted, and the damaged reactor shielded more permanently. About 200,000 people ('liquidators') from all
            over
            the Soviet Union were involved in the recovery and clean-up during 1986 and 1987. They received high doses
            of
            radiation, averaging around 100 millisieverts. Some 20,000 of them received about 250 mSv and a few received
            500
            mSv. Later, the number of liquidators swelled to over 600,000 but most of these received only low radiation
            doses. The highest doses were received by about 1000 emergency workers and on-site personnel during the
            first
            day of the accident.</p>
        <p class="seven"> The effects of radiation exposure fall into two main classes: deterministic effects, where the
            effect is certain to occur under given conditions (e.g. individuals exposed to several grays over a short
            period
            of time will definitely suffer Acute Radiation Syndrome); and stochastic effects, where the effect may or
            may
            not occur (e.g. an increase in radiation exposure may or may not induce a cancer in a particular individual
            but
            if a sufficiently large population receive a radiation exposure above a certain level, an increase in the
            incidence of cancer may become detectable in that population). UNSCEAR, 2011.</p>
        <p>Initial radiation exposure in contaminated areas was due to short-lived iodine-131; later caesium-137 was the
            main hazard. (Both are fission products dispersed from the reactor core, with half lives of 8 days and 30
            years,
            respectively. 1.8 EBq of I-131 and 0.085 EBq of Cs-137 were released.) About five million people lived in
            areas
            of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine contaminated (above 37 kBq/m2 Cs-137 in soil) and about 400,000 lived in more
            contaminated areas of strict control by authorities (above 555 kBq/m2 Cs-137). A total of 29,400 km2 was
            contaminated above 180 kBq/m2.</p>
        <p class="eight">* supposedly correlating with 1 mSv/yr dose with continuous exposure. About 23% of Belarus was
            contaminated to this level, with 7% of Ukraine and 1.5% of European Russia.</p>
        <p>The plant operators' town of Pripyat was evacuated on 27 April (45,000 residents). By 14 May, some 116,000
            people
            that had been living within a 30-kilometre radius had been evacuated and later relocated. About 1000 of
            these
            returned unofficially to live within the contaminated zone. Most of those evacuated received radiation doses
            of
            less than 50 mSv, although a few received 100 mSv or more.</p>
        <p class="nine">In the years following the accident, a further 220,000 people were resettled into less
            contaminated
            areas, and the initial 30 km radius exclusion zone (2800 km2) was modified and extended to cover 4300 square
            kilometres. This resettlement was due to application of a criterion of 350 mSv projected lifetime radiation
            dose, though in fact radiation in most of the affected area (apart from half a square kilometre) fell
            rapidly so
            that average doses were less than 50% above normal background of 2.5 mSv/yr. See also following section on
            Resettlement.</p>

        <p>Several organisations have reported on the impacts of the Chernobyl accident, but all have had problems
            assessing
            the significance of their observations because of the lack of reliable public health information before
            1986.
        </p>
        <p>In 1989, the World Health Organization (WHO) first raised concerns that local medical scientists had
            incorrectly
            attributed various biological and health effects to radiation exposureg. Following this, the Government of
            the
            USSR requested the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to coordinate an international experts'
            assessment
            of accident's radiological, environmental and health consequences in selected towns of the most heavily
            contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Between March 1990 and June 1991, a total of 50 field
            missions were conducted by 200 experts from 25 countries (including the USSR), seven organisations, and 11
            laboratories3. In the absence of pre-1986 data, it compared a control population with those exposed to
            radiation. Significant health disorders were evident in both control and exposed groups, but, at that stage,
            none was radiation related.</p>

        <p>In February 2003, the IAEA established the Chernobyl Forum, in cooperation with seven other UN organisations
            as
            well as the competent authorities of Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. In April 2005, the
            reports
            prepared by two expert groups – "Environment", coordinated by the IAEA, and "Health", coordinated by WHO –
            were
            intensively discussed by the Forum and eventually approved by consensus. The conclusions of this 2005
            Chernobyl
            Forum study (revised version published 2006i) are in line with earlier expert studies, notably the UNSCEAR
            2000
            reportj which said that "apart from this [thyroid cancer] increase, there is no evidence of a major public
            health impact attributable to radiation exposure 14 years after the accident. There is no scientific
            evidence of
            increases in overall cancer incidence or mortality or in non-malignant disorders that could be related to
            radiation exposure." As yet there is little evidence of any increase in leukaemia, even among clean-up
            workers
            where it might be most expected. However, these workers – where high doses may have been received – remain
            at
            increased risk of cancer in the long term. Apart from these, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the
            Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) says that "the great majority of the population is not likely to
            experience serious health consequences as a result of radiation from the Chernobyl accident. Many other
            health
            problems have been noted in the populations that are not related to radiation exposure."</p>
        <p>The Chernobyl Forum report says that people in the area have suffered a paralysing fatalism due to myths and
            misperceptions about the threat of radiation, which has contributed to a culture of chronic dependency. Some
            "took on the role of invalids." Mental health coupled with smoking and alcohol abuse is a very much greater
            problem than radiation, but worst of all at the time was the underlying level of health and nutrition. Apart
            from the initial 116,000, relocations of people were very traumatic and did little to reduce radiation
            exposure,
            which was low anyway. Psycho-social effects among those affected by the accident are similar to those
            arising
            from other major disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and fires.</p>
        <p>According to the most up-to-date estimate of UNSCEAR, the average radiation dose due to the accident received
            by
            inhabitants of 'strict radiation control' areas (population 216,000) in the years 1986 to 2005 was 31 mSv
            (over
            the 20-year period), and in the 'contaminated' areas (population 6.4 million) it averaged 9 mSv, a minor
            increase over the dose due to background radiation over the same period (about 50 mSv).</p>
        <p>The numbers of deaths resulting from the accident are covered most fully in the account of health effects
            provided by an annex to the UNSCEAR 2008 report, released in 2011.
            Some exaggerated figures have been published regarding the death toll attributable to the Chernobyl
            disaster. A
            publication by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) lent support to these.
            However,
            the Chairman of UNSCEAR made it clear that "this report is full of unsubstantiated statements that have no
            support in scientific assessments, and the Chernobyl Forum report also repudiates them.</p>
        <p>A particularly sad effect of the accident was that some physicians in Europe advised pregnant women to
            undergo
            abortions on account of radiation exposure, even though the levels concerned were vastly below those likely
            to
            have teratogenic effects. The foetal death toll from this is likely very much greater than directly from the
            accident.UNSCEAR in 2011 concludes: In summary, the effects of the Chernobyl accident are many and varied.
            Early
            deterministic effects can be attributed to radiation with a high degree of certainty, while for other
            medical
            conditions, radiation almost certainly was not the cause. In between, there was a wide spectrum of
            conditions.
            It is necessary to evaluate carefully each specific condition and the surrounding circumstances before
            attributing a cause.</p>
        <p>According to an UNSCEAR report in 2018, about 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed 1991-2015 in
            patients
            who were 18 and under at the time of the accident. The report states that a quarter of the cases 2001-2008
            were
            "probably" due to high doses of radiation, and that this fraction was likely to have been higher in earlier
            years, and lower in later years. However, it also states that the uncertainty around the attributed fraction
            is
            very significant – at least 0.07 to 0.5 – and that the influence of annual screenings and active follow-up
            make
            comparisons with the general population problematic. Thyroid cancer is usually not fatal if diagnosed and
            treated early; the report states that of the diagnoses made between 1991 and 2005 (6,848 cases), 15 proved
            to be
            fatal</p>
        <p class="eleven">Conifers in about 10 square kilometres of forest close to the plant were killed by the high
            radiation levels, but regeneration got underway from the following year. The net environmental effect of the
            accident has been much greater biodiversity and abundance of species. The exclusion zone has become a unique
            sanctuary for wildlife.</p>
        <div id="cap6"></div>
        <h1>Progressive closure of the Chernobyl plant</h1>
        <p>In the early 1990s, some US$400 million was spent on improvements to the remaining reactors at Chernobyl,
            considerably enhancing their safety. Energy shortages necessitated the continued operation of one of them
            (unit
            3) until December 2000. (Unit 2 was shut down after a turbine hall fire in 1991, and unit 1 at the end of
            1997.)
            Almost 6000 people worked at the plant every day, and their radiation dose has been within internationally
            accepted limits. A small team of scientists works within the wrecked reactor building itself, inside the
            shelterl.Workers and their families now live in a new town, Slavutich, 30 km from the plant. This was built
            following the evacuation of Pripyat, which was just 3 km away.</p>
        <p>Ukraine depends upon, and is deeply in debt to, Russia for energy supplies, particularly oil and gas, but
            also
            nuclear fuel. Although this dependence is gradually being reduced, continued operation of nuclear power
            stations, which supply half of total electricity, is now even more important than in 1986.</p>
        <p class="twelve">When it was announced in 1995 that the two operating reactors at Chernobyl would be closed by
            2000, a memorandum of understanding was signed by Ukraine and G7 nations to progress this, but its
            implementation was conspicuously delayed. Alternative generating capacity was needed, either gas-fired,
            which
            has ongoing fuel cost and supply implications, or nuclear, by completing Khmelnitski unit 2 and Rovno unit 4
            ('K2R4') in Ukraine. Construction of these was halted in 1989 but then resumed, and both reactors came on
            line
            late in 2004, financed by Ukraine rather than international grants as expected on the basis of Chernobyl's
            closure.</p>
        <h1 class="unit4">Unit 4 containment</h1>
        <p>Chernobyl unit 4 was enclosed in a large concrete shelter which was erected quickly (by October 1986) to
            allow
            continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant. However, the structure is neither strong nor
            durable.
            The international Shelter Implementation Plan in the 1990s involved raising money for remedial work
            including
            removal of the fuel-containing materials. Some major work on the shelter was carried out in 1998 and 1999.
            About
            200 tonnes of highly radioactive material remains deep within it, and this poses an environmental hazard
            until
            it is better contained.</p>
        <p>The New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure was completed in 2017, having been built adjacent and then moved
            into
            place on rails. It is an arch 110 metres high, 165 metres long and spanning 260 metres, covering both unit 4
            and
            the hastily-built 1986 structure. The arch frame is a lattice construction of tubular steel members,
            equipped
            with internal cranes. The design and construction contract for this was signed in 2007 with the Novarka
            consortium and preparatory work onsite was completed in 2010. Construction started in April 2012. The first
            half, weighing 12,800 tonnes, was moved 112 metres to a holding area in front of unit 4 in April 2014. The
            second half was completed by the end of 2014 and was joined to the first in July 2015. Cladding, cranes, and
            remote handling equipment were fitted in 2015. The entire 36,000 tonne structure was pushed 327 metres into
            position over the reactor building in November 2016, over two weeks, and the end walls completed. The NSC is
            the
            largest moveable land-based structure ever built.</p>
        <p>The hermetically sealed building will allow engineers to remotely dismantle the 1986 structure that has
            shielded
            the remains of the reactor from the weather since the weeks after the accident. It will enable the eventual
            removal of the fuel-containing materials (FCM) in the bottom of the reactor building and accommodate their
            characterisation, compaction, and packing for disposal. This task represents the most important step in
            eliminating nuclear hazard at the site – and the real start of dismantling. The NSC will facilitate remote
            handling of these dangerous materials, using as few personnel as possible. During peak construction of the
            NSC
            some 1200 workers were onsite.</p>
        <p>The Chernobyl Shelter Fund, set up in 1997, had received €864 million from international donors by early 2011
            towards this project and previous work. It and the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA), set up in 1993, are managed
            by
            the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The total cost of the new shelter was in 2011
            estimated to be €1.5 billion. In November 2014 the EBRD said the overall €2.15 billion Shelter
            Implementation
            Plan including the NSC had received contributions from 43 governments but still had a funding shortfall of
            €615
            million. The following month the EBRD made an additional contribution of €350 million in anticipation of a
            €165
            million contribution by the G7/European Commission, which was confirmed in April 2015. This left a balance
            of
            €100 million to come from non-G7 donors, and €15 million of this was confirmed in April 2015.</p>

        <h1>Resettlement of contaminated areas</h1>
        <p>In the last two decades there has been some resettlement of the areas evacuated in 1986 and subsequently.
            Recently
            the main resettlement project has been in Belarus.</p>
        <p>In July 2010, the Belarus government announced that it had decided to settle back thousands of people in the
            'contaminated areas' covered by the Chernobyl fallout, from which 24 years ago they and their forbears were
            hastily relocated. Compared with the list of contaminated areas in 2005, some 211 villages and hamlets had
            been
            reclassified with fewer restrictions on resettlement. The decision by the Belarus Council of Ministers
            resulted
            in a new national program over 2011-15 and up to 2020 to alleviate the Chernobyl impact and return the areas
            to
            normal use with minimal restrictions. The focus of the project is on the development of economic and
            industrial
            potential of the Gomel and Mogilev regions from which 137,000 people were relocated</p>
        <p>The main priority is agriculture and forestry, together with attracting qualified people and housing them.
            Initial infrastructure requirements will mean the refurbishment of gas, potable water and power supplies,
            while
            the use of local wood will be banned. Schools and housing will be provided for specialist workers and their
            families ahead of wider socio-economic development. Overall, some 21,484 dwellings are slated for connection
            to
            gas networks in the period 2011-2015, while about 5600 contaminated or broken down buildings are demolished.
            Over 1300 kilometres of road will be laid, and ten new sewerage works and 15 pumping stations are planned.
            The
            cost of the work was put at BYR 6.6 trillion ($2.2 billion), split fairly evenly across the years 2011 to
            2015
            inclusive.</p>
        <p>The feasibility of agriculture will be examined in areas where the presence of caesium-137 and strontium-90
            is
            low, "to acquire new knowledge in the fields of radiobiology and radioecology in order to clarify the
            principles
            of safe life in the contaminated territories." Land found to have too high a concentration of radionuclides
            will
            be reforested and managed. A suite of protective measures was set up to allow a new forestry industry whose
            products would meet national and international safety standards. In April 2009, specialists in Belarus
            stressed
            that it is safe to eat all foods cultivated in the contaminated territories, though intake of some wild food
            was
            restricted.</p>
        <p>Protective measures will be put in place for 498 settlements in the contaminated areas where average
            radiation
            dose may exceed 1 mSv per year. There were also 1904 villages with annual average effective doses from the
            pollution between 0.1 mSv and 1 mSv. The goal for these areas is to allow their re-use with minimal
            restrictions, although already radiation doses there from the caesium are lower than background levels
            anywhere
            in the world.The Belarus government decision was an important political landmark in an ongoing process.
            Studies
            reviewed by UNSCEAR show that the Chernobyl disaster caused little risk for the general population. A UN
            Development Program report in 2002 said that much of the aid and effort applied to mitigate the effects of
            the
            Chernobyl accident did more harm than good, and it seems that this, along with the Chernobyl Forum report,
            finally persuaded the Belarus authorities. In 2004 President Lukashenko announced a priority to repopulate
            much
            of the Chernobyl-affected regions of Belarus, and then in 2009 he said that he “wants to repopulate
            Chernobyl’s
            zone quickly”.</p>
        <p class="fourteen">In 2011 Chernobyl was officially declared a tourist attraction, with many visitors.In 2015
            the
            published results of a major scientific study showed that the mammal population of the exclusion zone
            (including
            the 2162 sq km Polessian State Radiation-Ecological Reserve – PSRER in Belarus) was thriving, despite land
            contamination. The “long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on
            mammal
            abundance.” The data “represent unique evidence of wildlife's resilience in the face of chronic radiation
            stress.” (Current Biology, Elsevier)</p>
        <div id="cap9"></div>
        <h1>What has been learned from the Chernobyl disaster?</h1>
        <p>Leaving aside the verdict of history on its role in melting the Soviet 'Iron Curtain', some very tangible
            practical benefits have resulted from the Chernobyl accident. The main ones concern reactor safety, notably
            in
            eastern Europe. (The US Three Mile Island accident in 1979 had a significant effect on Western reactor
            design
            and operating procedures. While that reactor was destroyed, all radioactivity was contained – as designed –
            and
            there were no deaths or injuries.)While no-one in the West was under any illusion about the safety of early
            Soviet reactor designs, some lessons learned have also been applicable to Western plants. Certainly the
            safety
            of all Soviet-designed reactors has improved vastly. This is due largely to the development of a culture of
            safety encouraged by increased collaboration between East and West, and substantial investment in improving
            the
            reactors.</p>
        <p>Modifications have been made to overcome deficiencies in all the RBMK reactors still operating. In these,
            originally the nuclear chain reaction and power output could increase if cooling water were lost or turned
            to
            steam, in contrast to most Western designs. It was this effect which led to the uncontrolled power surge
            that
            led to the destruction of Chernobyl 4 (see Positive void coefficient section in the information page on RBMK
            Reactors). All of the RBMK reactors have now been modified by changes in the control rods, adding neutron
            absorbers and consequently increasing the fuel enrichment from 1.8 to 2.4% U-235, making them very much more
            stable at low power (see Post accident changes to the RBMK section in the information page on RBMK
            Reactors).
            Automatic shut-down mechanisms now operate faster, and other safety mechanisms have been improved. Automated
            inspection equipment has also been installed. A repetition of the 1986 Chernobyl accident is now virtually
            impossible, according to a German nuclear safety agency report.</p>
        <p>Since 1989, over 1000 nuclear engineers from the former Soviet Union have visited Western nuclear power
            plants
            and there have been many reciprocal visits. Over 50 twinning arrangements between East and West nuclear
            plants
            have been put in place. Most of this has been under the auspices of the World Association of Nuclear
            Operators
            (WANO), a body formed in 1989 which links 130 operators of nuclear power plants in more than 30 countries
            (see
            also information page on Cooperation in the Nuclear Power Industry).</p>
        <p>Many other international programmes were initiated following Chernobyl. The International Atomic Energy
            Agency
            (IAEA) safety review projects for each particular type of Soviet reactor are noteworthy, bringing together
            operators and Western engineers to focus on safety improvements. These initiatives are backed by funding
            arrangements. The Nuclear Safety Assistance Coordination Centre database lists Western aid totalling almost
            US$1
            billion for more than 700 safety-related projects in former Eastern Bloc countries. The Convention on
            Nuclear
            Safety adopted in Vienna in June 1994 is another outcome.</p>
        <p>The Chernobyl Forum report said that some seven million people are now receiving or eligible for benefits as
            'Chernobyl victims', which means that resources are not targeting those most in need. Remedying this
            presents
            daunting political problems however.</p>
